*Line 22-23 no var / let / const declaration
*Line 25-29 this could be improved by making error function instead of if statement
*So many console logs, use comments
*Why 2 fetch functions?
*Too many lines of code to my liking
*From line 440: why add html in javascript when you can add it in html itself
#Good stuff
*A lot of comments explaining what happens
*You made an exception for when you don't give any input
