## Consolidation challenge
In this exercise we (see below) are learning the agile philosopy through the Scrum methodology. We invented a new company that translates lyrics from one lagnuage to the other using three APIs:
* api.chartlyrics for getting the song lyrics
* translate.yandex to actually translate the songs

## Objectives
* Learn to work in groups with an Agile approach
* Learn the value of stand up meetings and SCRUM
* Use some AB testing
* use google analytics
